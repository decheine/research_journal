# Bayesian Neural Networks Working Group

This document is a list of resources that I would like to go through for our Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) working group. This working group will consist of three key parts: theory, code and application. The theory part will allow us to have a deeper understanding about the relationship between normal Bayesian regression, neural networks and even deep Gaussian processes. The code is a great opportunity to learn about probabilistic programming in general and get some good coding skips. The last part is the applications perspective where we thinking hard about what we are applying the algorithms to and how we can modify them to work accordingly.
