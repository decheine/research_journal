# Programming Exercises

I found some really good programming exercises in this [class webpage](http://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/apml/exercises/). They have [lectures](http://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/apml/lectures) as well. It seems like they implement a lot of things from scratch. Topics include:

* Probabilistic Modeling
* Bayesian Linear Regression
* Bayesian Networks
* Monte Carlo Methods
* Variational Inference & Expectation Propagation
* Message Passing
* Gaussian Processes
