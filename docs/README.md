This is my research journal of various topics that I'm interested in for my research. My research is mostly in using Machine learning methods in various applications of remote sensing and climate sciences. The predominant algorithms of interest include kernel methods like Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Invertible Flows like Rotation-Based Iterative Gaussianization (RBIG) for density and dependence estimation.
