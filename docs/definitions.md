## Things to Avoid

Just a list of principles or things that I really want to avoid when doing science. I leave these here as a reminder.

> Desire to achieve a sought for (or simply publishable) result leads to fiddling with the data points, the modelling assumptions, or the research hypotheses themselves. - Satelli ([prezi](http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/Sensitivity_Analysis_Saltelli_Ranco.pdf))

#### P-Hacking

> Fishing for favourable p-values

**Paper**:

* A. Gelman and E. Loken, “The garden of forking paths: Why multiple comparisons can be a problem, even when there is no ‘fishing expedition’ or ‘p-hacking’ and the research hypothesis was posited ahead of time,” 2013
* Leamer, E. E. Tantalus on the Road to Asymptopia. J. Econ. Perspect. 24, 31–46 (2010)

#### HARKing

> Formulating the research **H**ypothesis **A**fter the **R**esults are **K**nown

**Paper**: 

* Kerr, N. L., HARKing: Hypothesizing After the Results are Known. Personal. Soc. Psychol. Rev. 2, 196217 (1998)

#### Data Fishing Expedition

> Finding data that gives your model the best results
