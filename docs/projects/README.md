## Similarity Measures

### Main Projects


**HSIC and Kernel Parameters**


In this study, I investigate the kernel parameters and the different methods we can use to estimate the kernels of these dependence measures. I assess the validity of each one by doing a full empirical study on 1D distributions and on N-D distributions. 

* Main Project
* HSIC Implementations
* Visualization

### [Software]()


**PySim**

A python package that I use as my base in order to explore different aspects of similarity measures. Some highlights include entropy, mutual information and KL-Divergence. I explore a few methods including K-Nearest Neighbors, kernel density estimation, Hilbert-Schmidt Criterion and Gaussianization methods.

### [Applications]()

## Uncertainty Quantification


### Main Projects


**Input Uncertainty**

* Assuming Input Error in the methods
* Extensive Literature review
* Looking at linearized and variational methods to propagate the errors through the GPs
* Applications to IASI satellite data and prediction
* Explore some relations to Kalman Filtering


**Gaussianization**


* Main Project

### Software

**RBIG 1.1**

This is a python package which a revamped API that makes it easier to prototype and try out different methods of Gaussianization. It is based off of the [deep-density-destructors]() repository but much simpler and scaled down for my needs. It's open source to allow other researchers to take a look at how one can do Gaussianization.

**RBIG 2.0**

This is the next iteration for Gaussianization to allow one to train it on GPUs. In this, I explore different ways we can use the normalizing flows architecture to do Gaussianization transformations.
