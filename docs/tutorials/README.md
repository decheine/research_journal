## NNs in PyTorch

!!! abstract
    Some basic tutorials about how one can code Neural networks from scratch. It will feature from scratch as well as how to refactor your code. The ultimate goal is to build Bayesian NN and a Deep GP from scratch. TBD

* Part I - [From Scratch](pytorch_nns/1_nn_from_scratch.md)
* Part II - [Refactored](pytorch_nns/2_refactor.md)
* eGP2.0 I - [Variational GP](../projects/ErrorGPs/Variational/egp_pyro_svgp/egp_pyro_svgp.md)

## Jax n EGPs

!!! abstract
    How to use Jax to do derivatives of kernel methods as well as how to use it for GPs with Uncertain Inputs.


* [vmap](jax/vmap.md)
* [jit](jax/jit.md)
* [GP From Scratch](../appendix/gps/1_introduction.md)
* eGP I - [Taylor Expansion](../projects/ErrorGPs/Taylor%20Expansion/taylor.md)
* eGP II - [MCMC](../projects/ErrorGPs/monte_carlo/demo.md)
