### Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Processes

These are essentially the analogue to the random fourier features for Gaussian processes.

    > This is a moment matching extension to deal with the uncertainty in the inputs at prediction time.

#### Variational SSGPs

So according to [this paper]() the SSGP algorithm had a tendency to overfit. So they added some additional parameters to account for the noise in the inputs making the marginal likelihood term intractable. They added variational methods to deal with the
